main<-tuesdata$countries
main2<-tuesdata$former_countries

  transmute(
    iso=alpha_3,
    name=name,
    former=F
  )%>%
  bind_rows(

    end=nchar(name)#as in the lenght of the name, later went unused
  )%>%

    first,second,third,name
  )%>%
  filter(!former)%>%#discovered figure doesnt need more points. Just current ends up very busy

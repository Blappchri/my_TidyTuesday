# The *#TidyTuesday* Works of Christoph Blapp

#TidyTuesday is an initiative of the Data Science Learning Community to provide a dataset each week for shared visualization practice. During a period of unemployment in mid-2024, I decided to start participating to keep my skills sharp. Any code created as part of that effort has been and will be stored within this repository.
